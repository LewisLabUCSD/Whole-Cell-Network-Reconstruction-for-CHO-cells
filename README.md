# Whole Cell Network Reconstruction for CHO cells

![CHO_Cells_Banner](banner_image_url_here)

Welcome to the **Whole Cell Network Reconstruction for CHO cells** repository! This project aims to create the most up-to-date and complete whole-cell network reconstruction for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Our goal is to enable researchers and biotechnologists to better understand CHO cell biology, optimize bioprocesses, and advance the field of cell line engineering.

## üß¨ Background

CHO cells are widely used as a platform for the production of recombinant proteins and biopharmaceuticals. However, despite their widespread use, our understanding of CHO cell biology remains limited. A comprehensive, high-quality whole-cell network reconstruction can help bridge this gap by providing a detailed blueprint of the cell's molecular components and their interactions.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

* Integrate the latest knowledge and data on CHO cell biology to create a comprehensive and accurate whole-cell network reconstruction.
* Develop a user-friendly platform for researchers to interact with and analyze the reconstructed network.
* Facilitate collaboration between researchers and the broader community to continuously update and improve the network reconstruction.

## üìö Data Sources

Our network reconstruction is based on a wide range of data sources, including:

* Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from CHO cells.
* Public databases such as KEGG, Reactome, and BioGRID.
* Published literature and experimental data from the research community.

We encourage researchers to contribute their data and knowledge to improve the quality of the network reconstruction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Methods

The repository contains a collection of tools and scripts for building, validating, and analyzing the whole-cell network reconstruction, including:

* Data preprocessing and integration scripts
* Network reconstruction algorithms
* Model validation and refinement tools
* Visualization and analysis tools
