Thanasis:
  - I will made a script to detect the different GPR rules between the 4 datasets, and then try to merge them to the final.
  - I'll see how to build the pipeline for the confidence score
  - I couldn't go anywhere with the gpruler
  - Maybe we can use this file, or some kind of file in GitHub to plan what are we going to do, or which are the main goals?
  - I also need to create a new branch for my changes, so to not make a mess :P 

Pablo Feb-02-2023:
  - I don't think the GPRuler tutorial is clear enough about how to run. Maybe I should take a second look at the paper.
  - I am also familiarizing myself with GitHub branching. I saw that you created a new notebook for the GPR merging, as long as we continue to work on
  different notebooks I don't think that overwritting code will be a problem, but it is definitely going to be important when we start working on the same notebooks.
  - The confidence score part its gonna be the most challenging, but definitely the most interesting part.
  - I've been working on the manual curation of some of the reactions. You can check the changes and updates on the Google Sheet file that I shared with you.

Pablo Feb-15-2023:
  - Creation of the Google Sheet notebook. This notebook is able to access the CHO Network Reconstruction Google Sheet file, retrieve information
  from that file and update the file.
  - Working on the get_gene_info function to retrieve information from NCBI.
 
 Pablo Feb-16-2023:
  - get_gene_info function is fixed. You can try it out by yourself with different gene IDs, even from other species to see if it works correctly.

   - Made a new branch, the getfix, with changes in googlesheet and comparegpr. In the end it automcatically assignes the gene information to the temporary google sheet.
   - But it only check for the first 10 genes, because it reaches a limit in the API requests. Maybe we need to get a license or somehting. 

Pablo Feb-17-2023:
   - I modified the googlesheet notebook in the new branch in order to add new features:
                                        - The gene_list for the loop at the end of the notebook is now obtained from the Rxns sheet of the temporary file on real time
                                        - I added an error cache and a time sleep of 5 secs to avoid reaching the Google API quota limit. Increasing the quota is not that simple.
                                        - I added another error cache to prevent the loop to overwrite data.
   
   - The idea would be now to generate that gene_list from the GPR_final column in which we would have the GPRs from the manual curation and also the computed GPRs from your function.
   
   Pablo Feb-23-2023:
   - I kept the notebook running for a while and it retrieved information for more than a 200 genes or so... So I think that the daily quota for the API is pretty much unlimited.
   - Still working on the gene ontology function. Its in a new notebook called Gene Ontology in case you want to take a look at it.
   - Feel free to work on main or create a new branch.

Than 24/2
  - I combined the GPR_Final and GPR_Final_Thanasis to GPR_Final. See if you agree, if not you can revert the chanegs from the hisotry in google sheets.
  - I can't seem to find the ontology for CHO, the bing chat gave me the idea of maybe we can chech if the gene sequence is the same in mouse and find 
     the ontology from there? Of if we fill the genes with the ontologies of Human and Mouse?
