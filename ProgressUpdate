Thanasis:
  - I will made a script to detect the different GPR rules between the 4 datasets, and then try to merge them to the final.
  - I'll see how to build the pipeline for the confidence score
  - I couldn't go anywhere with the gpruler
  - Maybe we can use this file, or some kind of file in GitHub to plan what are we going to do, or which are the main goals?
  - I also need to create a new branch for my changes, so to not make a mess :P

  - I don't think the GPRuler tutorial is clear enough about how to run. Maybe I should take a second look at the paper.
  - I am also familiarizing myself with GitHub branching. I saw that you created a new notebook for the GPR merging, as long as we continue to work on
  different notebooks I don't think that overwritting code will be a problem, but it is definitely going to be important when we start working on the same notebooks.
  - The confidence score part its gonna be the most challenging, but definitely the most interesting part.
  - I've been working on the manual curation of some of the reactions. You can check the changes and updates on the Google Sheet file that I shared with you.

Pablo Feb-15-2023:
  - Creation of the Google Sheet notebook. This notebook is able to access the CHO Network Reconstruction Google Sheet file, retrieve information
  from that file and update the file.
  - Working on the get_gene_info function to retrieve information from NCBI.
 
 Pablo Feb-16-2023:
  - get_gene_info function is fixed. You can try it out by yourself with different gene IDs, even from other species to see if it works correctly.
